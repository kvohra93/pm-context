# Some major points from Project Management Class

* An employee who works for an organization on a project is also a partial stakeholder due to their close involvement. 
* Deliverables are the working product we obtain at the end of each sprint
* The Scrum Methodology is just another form of the Agile Process
* PMI or Project Management Institute is a professional and non profile Group which designed efficient standards in managing projects with most efficiency
* Interaction, and getting help from team when stuck somewhere is better than bearing the weight of the world on your shoulders
* Accurate prediction of the ETA for an alotted task makes a really valueable emoloyee for an organization


# Class #3 - 5/13/2021

## PMBOK Process Groups
* PMBOK defines a number of process groups and Knowledge areas which are closely related.
* It is a tradeoff between the planning process group and executing process groups - Most of the time on a project is spent of one of these
* However, it is more sensible to plan and cover all corners instead of starting off unorganized
 
 ## Boards, Issues and issue types
 *  *Boards*  are used to create a composite repository of documentation, issues with the project, reference materials etc. for the purpose of Project Management
 *  *Issues*  can be a various number of things in practicality
 *  *Status of an issue* defines wheather an issue is being worked on, is done and closed with updated comments or is simply done
 
 * Generally it is something which needs to be done on the Project or some sort of design specification or documentation
 * buggs can be added here
 * some default labels on issues are 
      * bug  -  Some inconsistent behavior w.r.t the expected design    
      * invalid -   Some behaviour which is reported as an issue but has been marked as not an issue
      * duplicate   -   A piece of information which pre-existed in the issue list
      * documentation -  Some form of information posted as reference materials in the Execution phase 
\
 * It is an easy and convinient tool to learn and can really help in managing a project.
