# Some major points from Project Management Class

* An employee who works for an organization on a project is also a partial stakeholder due to their close involvement. 
* Deliverables are the working product we obtain at the end of each sprint
* The Scrum Methodology is just another form of the Agile Process
* PMI or Project Management Institute is a professional and non profile Group which designed efficient standards in managing projects with most efficiency
* Interaction, and getting help from team when stuck somewhere is better than bearing the weight of the world on your shoulders
* Accurate prediction of the ETA for an alotted task makes a really valueable emoloyee for an organization
